Some weights of BertForQuestionAnswering were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['qa_outputs.bias', 'qa_outputs.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision
